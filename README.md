# Landing_Page

This is my first completed project for The Odin Project and my first completed project using HTML and CSS. I know it's not completely beautiful but I tried my best to make it look like the solution. 

This features fixed positions in css which I know can/will be in issue in resized windows but for now it's done. 

If you're reading this and have any insights they would be greatly appreciated . 

If you also think I should get a dog, let me know. 

Thanks for the support
